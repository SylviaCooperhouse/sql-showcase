# **SQL Mastery Showcase**

üìå **Repository:** [SQL Mastery Showcase](https://github.com/SylviaCooperhouse/sql-showcase)  
üìå **Tech Stack:** PostgreSQL | MySQL | SQL Server  

---

## üöÄ **Overview**
This repository is a **curated collection** of SQL queries, database designs, and optimizations commonly encountered in interviews and real-world applications. It serves as both a **learning tool** and a **reference guide** for SQL mastery.

The repository includes:
- **Core SQL Querying**: SELECT, JOINs, GROUP BY, Aggregations, and Window Functions.
- **Performance Optimization**: Indexing strategies, query execution plans, and best practices for database efficiency.
- **Advanced Data Analysis**: Recursive CTEs, ranking queries, customer segmentation, and business intelligence metrics.
- **Transaction Handling & Error Control**: Safe database modifications using COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and stored procedures.
- **Real-World SQL Challenges**: Practical queries modeled after actual business cases.
